Dota Trading Calculator for Heroes LVL 1

Small project to get myself familiar with typescript and classes. 
In this regard the design came a bit short. Also the calculator does not work on mobile.

The calculator takes 2 heroes and simulates a fight between them. 
The idea came to mind since trading hits in the early game of dota is very important.
The calculator simulates when you benefit from trading with a specific hero against a specific opponent
and when it is better to try avoiding hit-trading.

You can buy items for 600 Gold (starting gold in dota), which boost your health regen, damage and/or armor.
